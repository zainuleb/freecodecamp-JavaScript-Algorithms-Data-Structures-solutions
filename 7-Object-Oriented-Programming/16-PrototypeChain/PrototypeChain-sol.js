                    Understand the Prototype Chain

All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object.
Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.

Your code should show that Object.prototype is the prototype of Dog.prototype
