                            Define a Constructor Function

Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. 
Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

Create a constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs that are set to a string, a string, and a number, 
respectively.

/* 
Dog should have a name property set to a string.
Dog should have a color property set to a string.
Dog should have a numLegs property set to a number.
